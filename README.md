**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting stroke occurrence using machine learning algorithms. Early prediction of strokes can save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the quality of patient care. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of stroke based on various factors such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle habits.

The goal is to train a model that can predict whether an individual is at risk of having a stroke, using a dataset that contains various health-related features.

**Key Features:**

- **Predictive Modeling:** Applying classification algorithms to predict stroke occurrence.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Applying different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and others for classification.
