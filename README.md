**Overview**

This repository implements a Stroke Prediction model using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on several health-related features, including age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and others. The project uses historical data from health records and applies data mining techniques to build a predictive model.

By predicting stroke occurrence, this model aims to provide a proactive approach to healthcare, enabling early interventions that could potentially save lives and reduce medical costs.

**Key Features**

**Dataset:**

The dataset includes various health features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, and others that contribute to stroke prediction.

**Machine Learning Algorithms:**

Implemented several machine learning algorithms to predict stroke risk, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

**Model Evaluation:**

Utilizes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of the predictive models.

**Data Preprocessing:**

Includes steps for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

**Visualization:**

Provides insights into feature importance and model performance using various plots.
